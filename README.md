### HARVESTED.IO
Decentralized, Responsible, Sustainable, & Affordable Internet Capacity.
Cultivated by ThreeFold Farmers. 

### WHAT IS HARVESTED.IO?
Harvest is the portal for you to buy internet capacity at a fraction of competion's costs. The capacity sold on Harvest comes from a decentralized internet grid called the ThreeFold Grid and all capacity you buy at Harvest is purchased directly from ThreeFold Farmers: individuals putting capacity on the grid.


### WHY BUY AT HARVESTED.IO?
The compute, storage and network resources on the ThreeFold Grid have wide array of upsides besides being very cost efficient.

### SUSTAINABLE
The less = more approach of the architecture makes it possible to run on a 10th of the power that convention infrastructure uses

### DECENTRALIZED
There is no big corporation that owns the capacity nor the data residing on the capacity. A responsible internet grid by many, to be used by all.

### AT THE EDGE
Due to the decentralized nature of the grid there is almost always capacity available near you and your users. Saves time, money and frustration.
